# iVote-Assignment
iVote Assignment for CS356
SimDriver uses the other classes to run the iVote service.
Student.java submits votes based on the answer type (multiple choice or true/false)
Question.java generates a question, answer type, and if applicable, answer options via user input
IVoteService.java takes votes from Student.java and counts them. It can also display the stats from voting
